//Phase 1:
//DONE ----- FE visuals for the page 
//DONE ----- Basic Server using express
//DONE ----- (came with the index.js) Create a few array variables that will hold the data
//DONE ----- Set of routes for getting and posting data
//DONE ----- routes for displaying html pages
//fetch to run ajax calls to Get and Post data from users to the express server (json db)






//Phase 2: DONE DONE
//DONE ----- Basic Express server that listents to pport 3000 when node.js is run
//DONE ----- Create 2 html files, home.html, notes.html. Use dummy data and create pages similar 

//Phase 3:
//Create a set of variables (hint: arrays of objects) for holding the data
//DONE ----- Create a set of routes that then display this data as JSONs. Users should be given these JSONs if they visit the appropriate page (i.e. if a user visits localhost:3000/api/tables they should see a JSON of table data
///DONE ----- Make sure the routes display the html pages 


//Phase 4
//Logic to handle the create entries/notes 
//code should work such that POST requests take in JSON objects, checks if there is any space left, then adds the JSON object to either the reservation array or the waitlist array. Your POST route should also respond to requests with a confirmation (true or false) of whether or not the requestor has a reservation (or is on the waiting list).
//You should be using Insomnia Core to do all your testing at this point.
//how AJAX can be used to do both GET and POST requests?? then create the necessary code on your tables.html page such that it can retrieve data from the Backend Team's API. In essence you will be creating an AJAX GET request to retrieve the data
//Then create the necessary code on your reserve.html page such that it can send data to the Backend Team's API. In essence you will be creating an AJAX POST request to send the data


//DONE:
